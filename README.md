# CMPSC-431W-Project
This project incorporates PostgreSQL into a command line interface using the Python 3 and the Psycopg2 Library

## How to start:
The first thing to do is download the file main.py. This file contains everything that is needed to run the Command Line Interface.
Then download all the csv files for all the tables.
Import those csv files into a database
Once that is all done install psycopg2
`pip install psycopg2-binary`
