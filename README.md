# CMPSC-431W-Project
This project incorporates PostgreSQL into a command line interface using the Python 3 and the Psycopg2 Library

## How to start:
1. The first thing to do is download the file main.py. This file contains everything that is needed to run the Command Line Interface.
2. Then download all the csv files for all the tables.
3. Import those csv files into a database
4. Once that is all done install psycopg2 <br />
`pip install psycopg2-binary` <br />

## Next Steps:
Once you have finished all the starting steps<br />
Make sure that you have the database name, host, username, password, and port of your database<br />
After you have that information you are able to start running the CLI<br />
Navigate to the directory that has the main.py file<br />

### If you have only Python 3 installed run:
`python main.py` <br />
### If you have multiple version of Python installed run:
`python3 main.py` <br />

## Go to the videos directory if you are having any trouble with how to use the CLI
